## Overview
**Hypeloop** is designed to let you discover and share short-form videos in a fast and immersive way. Rather than scrolling through a long list, you simply *swipe* to move on, save, or share. You can also upload your own short videos to let others join your creative journey.  

---

## Getting Started
1. **Install & Open the App**  
   - Download **Hypeloop** onto your iPhone (or iPad).  
   - Launch the app to start exploring.  

2. **Create an Account or Log In** (see next section)  
   - You can use Apple Sign In or an email and password.  

3. **Explore Videos**  
   - Immediately, you'll see a video. Tap, double tap, or swipe to interact.  

---

## Account Login & Signup
When you first open **Hypeloop**, you'll see the **Login** screen.

1. **Email & Password**  
   - Enter your email address and desired password.  
   - Tap **Login** if you already have an account, or **Sign Up** to create a new one.

2. **Sign in with Apple**  
   - Simply tap the "Sign in with Apple" button.  
   - Approve the sign-in request on your device to be securely logged in.

> **Tip**: If you ever forget your password or run into issues, you can reset it by standard Firebase reset links (you'll be guided through the process in the app).

---

## Home Screen & Video Controls
Once you're logged in, you'll see the **Home** tab by default – this is your main video feed.

### Tap to Pause or Play Video
- **Single Tap** on the video:
  - If the video is playing, it will **pause**.  
  - If the video is paused, it will **play** again.  
  - A small on-screen symbol (Play/Pause icon) briefly appears to show what happened.

### Double Tap to Restart Video
- **Double Tap** on the video:
  - The current video immediately restarts from the beginning.  
  - A **restart** icon (arrow in a circle) flashes on screen to confirm.

---

## Swipe Actions
One of the most powerful features in **Hypeloop** is the **swipe**. Each direction triggers a different action on the video you're currently watching:

### Left / Right Swipes
- **Left Swipe** or **Right Swipe**:  
  - Moves on to the **next video**.  
  - A **thumbs up** (right) or **thumbs down** (left) icon flashes as an indicator.  
  - These gestures can help you quickly skip videos you're not interested in or nudge the algorithm about preferences.

### Up Swipe (Share)
- **Swipe Up**:  
  - Opens your phone's **Share** menu, allowing you to share the video link via any app you like (Messages, social media, email, etc.).  
  - After swiping up, you also **move on** to the next video.

### Down Swipe (Save)
- **Swipe Down**:  
  - **Saves** the current video to your personal "Saved Videos" list.  
  - You automatically move on to the next video.

> **Hint**: If you swipe too lightly and haven't reached the threshold, the video will snap back in place. A bold swipe gesture helps confirm your action.

## Saved Videos
Looking for a place to quickly re-watch your favorites? **Saved Videos** are found in the **Profile** tab.

1. **Accessing Your Saved Videos**  
   - Tap the **Person** icon in the navigation bar (bottom of the screen).  
   - Scroll down to see your saved clips in a **grid** layout.

2. **Re-watch**  
   - Tap on a saved clip to open it and watch.

### Downloading & Sharing
- **Download**  
  - Below each thumbnail, you'll see a small download icon (a downward arrow in a box).  
  - Tapping it will start a download to your device's **Files** app.  
  - Once complete, iOS's Share menu lets you move it to Photos or another app.
- **Copy Link**  
  - Long-press the same button to **copy** the direct video link to your clipboard if you prefer.

### Removing a Saved Video
- **Long Press** on any saved video's thumbnail, then choose **Delete** (Trash icon).  
  - Removes it from your saved list (but doesn't delete the video from the platform entirely).

## Uploading Your Own Video
Ready to share your content? Go to the **Create** tab (video camera icon).

1. **Pick a Video**  
   - Tap **Select Video** to pick a clip from your device's library.  
   - A progress indicator will appear if it needs **optimization** or compressing.

2. **Add a Description**  
   - Briefly describe what's in your clip.  
   - This helps others understand or find your content.

3. **Upload**  
   - Tap **Upload**.  
   - You'll see a progress bar. Once it reaches 100% and a checkmark appears, your video is processed on our servers and will appear on the feed soon.

> **Note**: Large videos may take a bit longer, but you're free to use other apps while uploading. You can return later to check progress.

---

## Logging Out
If you need to log out:
- **Long Press** the **Home** icon or **Profile** icon in the bottom navigation bar.  
- Choose **Logout** from the menu.  
- You can log back in anytime using either email/password or Apple Sign In.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

1. **"I can't see any new videos."**  
   - If you see "You're all caught up!", that means you've watched all available videos. Try tapping the "Refresh" button or check back later.

2. **"My upload got stuck or failed."**  
   - Make sure you have a stable internet connection. If it fails, retry from the **Create** tab.  
   - If that doesn't solve it, force-close the app and try again.

3. **"I can't log in with my password."**  
   - Tap "Forgot Password?" or check your email address spelling. Apple Sign In is also a quick alternative if you have trouble.

4. **"Why don't I see my friend's videos?"**  
   - Hypeloop uses an automatic system to sequence videos. If your friend recently uploaded, wait a bit for processing or refresh your feed.

5. **"Where do my downloads go?"**  
   - By default, iOS saves to your **Files** app (in "On My iPhone" or "iCloud Drive"). You can open from there or share it to Photos.

For any other issues or feature requests, feel free to reach out to the Hypeloop team or check for updates in the App Store!
